## Introduction
The objective of our project is ot implement a algo trading bot. The advantage of algo trading on manual trading are related to speed, accuracy and reduced costs. Trading with algorithms has the advantage of scanning and executing on multiple indicators ata a speed that no human could do. One of the biggest advantages of the algo trading is tha ability to remove human emotion from the markets, as trades are constrained within a set of predefined criteria.
## Methodology
In this project, we made many popular indicators such as RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Osc, Pivot points etc. using the python and then we backtested them on the historical data of EUR/USD.
In stock trading bid-ask spreads play a major role. Many strategis that beats the market standered before trading costs but when we add trading costs, their profitability reduced significantly.
So, best time to trade when bid-ask spreads are lower. To find this, we analyse the historical data of EUR/USD on different granularities and find when the spreads are lower and we can cover our maximum costs.  
Then we made a trader file and connect it with Oanda api. Using this file we can control our trading account and make automate our trading journey.
